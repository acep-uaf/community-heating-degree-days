# Community Heating Degree Days
This repository contains source code to fetch and process heating degree day data for the communities represented in the [Alaska Energy Data Gateway (AEDG)](https://aedg-dev.camio.acep.uaf.edu). Input data comes from [Scenarios Network for Alaska + Arctic Planning (SNAP)](https://uaf-snap.org) in the form of AK-wide gridded rasters. In order to associate raster data with specific communities, this gridded data needs to be clipped to the communities and the values outputted to tabular format. This repo aims to do just that.
